                            <p>Photography has been a hobby of mine for almost 10 years now, starting when I was just
                                11.</p>
                            <p>Specifically capturing cameras with film. The first film camera that I've ever had was
                                the Pentax K1000.</p>
                            <p>It was one of the most beautifully designed cameras that I've ever owned. Following that
                                was the Canon canonet, and then the Canon AE-1.</p>
                            <p>I want to show the world what I see thru my eyes, and a camera does a very good job at
                                doing that.</p>

                            <p>I've at least created 3 blogs throughout my lifetime for the sole purpose of bettering my
                                writing.</p>
                            <p>And none of them have lasted at all. I hope this time will be the last blog that I
                                create.</p>
                            <p>Not only that, but I have been inspired by a group of awesome people to create a blog.
                            </p>
                            <p>I've read their blog throughout the entirety of it, and I have essentially seen just how much
                                they have beautifully progressed throughout their life.</p>
                            <p>When I'm old, I hope to read my own story and progress.</p>

                            <p>I am extremely passionate about new technologies.</p>

                            <p>Currently, I am implementing a vacuumless brake booster, and electric power steering to
                                create a self driving car using Comma.AI</p>
                            <p>I hope to create a post on it soon.</p>
